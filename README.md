Create a Vagrant VM to install the Virtual Background solution by Ben Elder: https://elder.dev/posts/open-source-virtual-background/

- Virtualization provider: VirtualBox
- Base OS: Debian 9 Stretch

The default host webcam is attached to the guest VM on startup. This is based on earlier work by Kenta Yonekura: https://github.com/yoneken/Win-vagrant-Ubuntu-webcam
